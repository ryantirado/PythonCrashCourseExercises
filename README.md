# DS-Assignments

Welcome to my Assignments repository! This repository is a part of my data science learning journey. It includes various assignments and exercises from different sources, starting with "Python Crash Course: A Hands-On, Project-Based Introduction to Programming" by Eric Matthes.

## Overview

The repository is organized into sections based on the source material. The first section covers my work through Eric Matthes' book, chapter by chapter (excluding Chapter 1), focusing on Python programming fundamentals. I believe that a strong foundation in programming is essential for data science, which is why I'm including materials that may not be directly related to data science but are crucial for building the necessary skills.

## Eric Matthes - Python Crash Course

- **Chapter 2 - Variables and Simple Data Types**: Delving into Python variables, strings, and numbers.
- **Chapter 3 - Introducing Lists**: Exploring lists in Python and their manipulation.
- (Continue)

Each chapter includes code implementations for the "Try it Yourself" exercises, supplemented with my notes and insights.

## Future Assignments

This repository will be continuously updated with assignments from various other sources as I progress in my programming and data science journey.

## Purpose

The aim of this repository is to track my progress, improve my programming skills, and provide a practical approach to learning new concepts.

## Using this Repository

This repository is a resource for anyone interested in learning data science or Python programming. It includes Python scripts or Jupyter notebooks with detailed comments explaining the code and concepts.
